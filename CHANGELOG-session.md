# Session Changelog — Hardening & Geo Map

## 🚀 REAL BACKEND — Phase 1 (auth + listings) DONE & multi-user verified

The app is no longer single-device. Extended the existing Express server into a
real backend with a persistent JSON datastore (`db.js`) and token auth.

- `server.js`: REST API for auth/profile, listings, requests, opportunities,
  bids (+ atomic award), messages. Owner-scoped reads. Sessions via Bearer token.
  Passwords never returned to the client. Runs on :3001; Vite proxies `/api`.
- `src/lib/api.js`: client with token management.
- `AuthContext` + `SellerListingContext` rewritten to use the backend (same hook
  surface, so screens barely changed). Listing screens scope to the current
  seller; buyers browse all.
- **Verified live multi-user:** seller@site.com created a Boone, NC listing →
  persisted server-side (`data.json`, geocoded) → a *separate* buyer@site.com
  account in a fresh session saw it on Browse. Console clean.
- Data store (`data.json`) is gitignored.

## 🚀 REAL BACKEND — Phase 2 (full loop) DONE & multi-user verified

Moved requests, opportunities, and bids onto the backend too (InquiryContext +
HaulBidContext rewritten; atomic award via a dedicated server endpoint). Added
DELETE endpoints for the "clear" actions. Consumers updated to async
(BuyerRequest, SellerInquiryDetails accept/award, HaulerHaulOpportunity bid).

- **Verified live across THREE separate accounts:** buyer@site.com requests →
  seller@site.com sees + accepts → hauler@site.com bids → seller awards → hauler
  sees "Locked / Winner". Every step crossed the network through the shared store
  with correct per-user scoping. Console clean.
- The 3-account test caught a real bug: awarded opportunities dropped out of the
  hauler's view — fixed so haulers still see opps they've bid on.
- **Messages now on the backend too** (loaded per-thread on demand). Verified
  live: a seller's message persists server-side and reloads from the server when
  the thread is reopened. **No data store uses localStorage anymore** — only the
  session token does.
- **Password hashing added** (scrypt, built into Node — no deps). New signups are
  hashed; legacy plaintext accounts transparently upgrade to a hash on next login.
  Verified: new + legacy logins work, wrong passwords rejected, stored values are
  `scrypt$…`.
- **Per-resource write authorization tightened.** PATCH request/opportunity now
  enforce ownership. Verified: seller (owns listing) 200, unauthorized user 403,
  no token 401.

**Dev runs as one command:** Vite now auto-starts the API server via a dev-only
plugin (`vite.config.js`), so `npm run dev` (or just `vite`) boots both UI and
backend — no separate step. Server exits quietly if its port is already taken
(safe double-start). Same behavior locally and on Replit.



App: **SoilConnect** (Site-Sync) — soil marketplace (buyer ↔ seller ↔ hauler).
Run goal (per Alex): make it a solid, bug-free app + real Google Maps geo map + simulated login. No payments (subscription model). No backend yet.

Dev server runs locally on **http://localhost:5173** (port 5000 is taken by macOS Control Center).
Node 20 installed at `~/.local/node-v20.18.1-darwin-x64/bin` (no system Node).

## 🗺️ Geo map switched to free OpenStreetMap (no key needed)

Alex opted to switch from Google Maps to **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap** (free, no API
key, no billing) — Google required his account + billing, which can't be provisioned
for him. Done & **verified live**:
- `BuyerMapView` now renders a real Leaflet/OSM map with listing markers, popups
  ("View details"), and auto-fit-to-markers. Verified: tiles load, 2 markers from
  real geocoded listings, popup works, console clean. (Screenshots captured.)
- Geocoding switched to free **Nominatim**. Verified live: "Asheville, NC" geocoded
  to lat/lng on listing creation, marker appeared on the map.
- Removed `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` + the `APIProvider` wrapper + `.env.example`.
  No env key required anymore. Data model unchanged (`lat`/`lng`/`geoFormatted`), so
  Google can be swapped back later if ever wanted.

## 📍 Detail-page location maps (new)

The buyer listing-details page and the request-details page now show a small map
of the location (reusing `RouteMiniMap` with a single point). Only render when the
record has coordinates. Verified live (listing + request both show a marker).

## 🛣️ Pickup→dropoff route mini-map (new)

The hauler opportunity page now shows a small Leaflet map with pickup + dropoff
markers connected by a route line (reusable `RouteMiniMap` component; shared
`leafletSetup` for marker icons). Renders only when coords are present. Verified
live: Raleigh→Charlotte route drawn, console clean.

## 🔔 Seller request-count badges (new)

Each card on the seller's "Your Listings" page now shows the number of buyer
requests on its "View Requests (N)" button, so sellers see which listings have
activity without opening each. Verified live.

## 📊 Live KPI dashboards (new)

The three role landing pages were nav-cards only; now each shows at-a-glance live
counts (using the previously-unused `.kpi-*` styles): Seller → active listings /
buyer requests / awarded hauls; Buyer → your requests / listings available; Hauler →
open opportunities / bids placed / awarded. Verified live with real counts; console
clean. Also refreshed a couple of stale card descriptions (e.g. Map View).

## 🔎 Proximity search for buyers (new)

Browse Listings gained a "Near a location" field: type a city/zip/jobsite (or
"Use my location" via browser geolocation) and listings are measured + sorted
nearest-first, each showing "~N mi away". Serves the core buyer use case ("find
material near my jobsite"). Verified live: from Charlotte, Asheville listing (~99 mi)
sorts above Raleigh listing (~130 mi). Console clean.

## 📏 Distance-aware haul opportunities (new)

Builds on the geo data: haulers now see **haul distance** (pickup→dropoff), the key
driver of their bid. Haversine helper in `src/lib/maps.js`; opportunities capture
pickup/dropoff coords at accept time; distance shows on the hauler dashboard cards
and the opportunity detail page. Verified live: Raleigh→Charlotte listing/request
geocoded, accepted, hauler dashboard shows "~130 mi haul". Console clean.

## 🧪 Verified live this session (full coverage)

Complete loop, exercised in the running app with the auth guard + all fixes in place:
**sign up / log in → seller posts listing → buyer browses → listing details →
request (prefilled) → seller sees request → accept → haul opportunity created →
hauler places bid → seller awards bid → hauler side shows "Locked".** Auth guard
verified both directions (logged-out bounces to login, logged-in gets access).
Data persists across a dev-server restart. Console clean at every step.

## ✅ Done & verified (this hardening run)

- **Fixed unstyled core screens.** `.page`, `.page-header`, `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.input`, plus form-error classes were used by `SellerInquiryDetails` and `HaulerHaulOpportunity` but defined nowhere — those screens rendered as raw HTML. Added all classes to `App.css`. Verified live: the seller inquiry screen now renders proper glass cards + styled buttons.
- **Fixed app-wide console errors.** `src/index.jsx` called `createRoot()` unguarded (double-root on HMR → `removeChild` DOM errors) and had a `GlobalErrorPanel` debug scaffold that hijacked the screen on any window error. Replaced with a clean, single-root, production-shaped entry. Verified: console is now clean.
- **Hardened the ErrorBoundary.** Was a dead-end "open DevTools" dump; now has "Try again" + "Go to home" recovery actions and collapsible technical details.
- **Catch-all route added.** Unknown URLs previously rendered blank; now redirect to `/`.
- **Fixed unstable React keys.** `BuyerBrowseListings`, `ListingDetails`, `HaulerDashboard` used `Math.random()` in `key` (remount every render) — now stable index fallbacks.

- **Simulated auth (Task #2) — DONE & verified.** `AuthContext` (localStorage):
  signup/login/logout/updateProfile, email + password validation, duplicate-email
  guard; the session user never stores the password. `LoginScreen`/`SignupScreen`
  rebuilt with controlled inputs + inline errors + Enter-to-submit. `ProfileScreen`
  prefills from the account, saves name/company/phone/region/roles, logout, and a
  signed-out fallback. Verified live: signup, validation, wrong/right login, logout,
  profile save persisting across sessions.
- **Real geo map (Task #3) — BUILT (tiles pending your key).** `@vis.gl/react-google-maps`
  installed. `src/lib/maps.js` (key read from `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `geocodeAddress`,
  `hasCoords`). `<APIProvider>` mounts app-wide only when a key exists. Listings and
  requests now best-effort geocode on save (lat/lng stored; no-ops without a key).
  `BuyerMapView` rebuilt as a real Google Map with listing markers + info windows +
  "View details", and a clean setup fallback (with a textual listing list) when no key.
  `.env.example` documents setup. Verified live WITHOUT a key: fallback renders, publish
  still saves, console clean. The actual map-tile rendering needs your key to confirm.

- **Final regression pass (Task #4) — DONE.** After auth + map + entry-point
  changes, re-ran the entire loop live: buyer browse → request → seller accept →
  haul opportunity → hauler dashboard. All green, console clean. Map fallback
  screen verified (screenshot-confirmed).

- **Bug sweep (Task #1) — DONE.** Full read-only audit of `src/` (the first
  background agent died with a process restart; re-ran it foreground). Codebase
  came back clean overall — defensive guards, no import/export mismatches, no
  unstable keys, all routes resolve. Acted on the real findings:
  - **(HIGH)** `SellerInquiryDetails`: the "no accepted request" branch could
    surface a haul opportunity + bids for a listing with no accepted request
    (listingId fallback). Now returns null unless a request is accepted.
  - **(hardening)** Added a `ready` guard to all four data contexts (Inquiry,
    SellerListing, HaulBid, Message) so the save effect can't write empty initial
    state over stored data — matches AuthContext. Verified: data survives restart.
  - **(MEDIUM)** Added a `RequireAuth` route guard — `/mode` and all
    buyer/seller/hauler/profile/messages routes redirect to `/login` when signed
    out. Verified: logged-out → login; logged-in → access; console clean.
  - Made `geocodeAddress` load the geocoding library on demand so it works with
    a key regardless of init order.
  - Audit non-issues (acknowledged, no action): bare `confirm()` (browser-safe),
    one-directional MessageThread (no buyer composer yet) — product gaps, not bugs.

## 🔁 Still open

- **Per-user data:** listings/requests are global in localStorage (any signed-in
  user sees all). Real per-account scoping is a backend concern (next milestone).

## ⚠️ Needs Alex

- Nothing required for the map anymore — it's free OpenStreetMap, works out of the
  box. (You'll just sign up in your browser to get past the login gate.)

## Earlier this session (already shipped)

Wired 6 orphaned routes; converted `BuyerListingDetails` from props to router; fixed the buyer→seller request loop (`inquiries` alias) and a hauler crash (`useHaulBid` export); built the seller→hauler accept→opportunity link; added listing edit/pause, buyer request details, message persistence + entry point; removed dead duplicates. Full buyer→seller→hauler loop verified live.
